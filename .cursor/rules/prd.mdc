# Product Requirements: Digital Business Card Scanner

This rule enforces the functional requirements for the Digital Business Card website. All features and implementations must align with the following user stories and expected outcomes:

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| FR001 | Uploading Business Card Image | As a user, I want to upload a photo of a business card so I can digitize it. | The system should provide an upload interface that accepts image files (JPG, PNG) of business cards. |
| FR002 | OCR Text Extraction | As a user, I want the system to automatically extract text from my card image. | The system should use OCR to detect and extract text information from the uploaded business card image. |
| FR003 | Information Categories | As a user, I want the extracted information to be organized into categories (name, phone, email, etc.). | The system should categorize extracted text into predefined fields like name, title, company, phone, email, and address. |
| FR004 | Editing Extracted Info | As a user, I want to edit the extracted information if there are any errors. | The system should allow users to modify any automatically extracted information before saving. |
| FR005 | Saving Digital Cards | As a user, I want to save the processed business card to my collection. | The system should store the card image and extracted information in the user's digital card collection. |
| FR006 | Viewing Card Collection | As a user, I want to view all my saved business cards in one place. | The system should provide a dashboard showing all saved business cards with their key information. |
| FR007 | Searching Cards | As a user, I want to search through my saved cards using various criteria. | The system should allow searching by name, company, or other fields within the saved cards. |
| FR008 | Sharing Digital Cards | As a user, I want to share my digital business cards with others. | The system should generate shareable links for individual cards or the entire collection. |
| FR009 | Exporting Contact Info | As a user, I want to export card information to standard formats (vCard, CSV). | The system should provide export options for contact information in common formats. |
| FR010 | Card Organization | As a user, I want to organize my cards into groups or categories. | The system should allow creating folders or tags to organize saved business cards. |
| FR011 | Mobile Compatibility | As a user, I want to capture and process cards directly from my mobile device. | The system should work smoothly on mobile devices with camera integration. |
| FR012 | Data Privacy | As a user, I want my uploaded card information to be secure and private. | The system should implement proper security measures to protect stored business card data. |
| FR013 | Card Backside & Social Profile | As a user, I want to flip the business card to see the back, which shows my profile, links, QR code, and social icons. | The system should allow flipping the card to reveal a profile page with avatar, name, description, main links, QR code, and social icons, styled as a modern digital profile card. The QR code button should replace the backside content with a large QR code image. The QR code content (URL) should be user-definable, but is not implemented yet. |

**Detailed Rules for Card Flip & Backside (FR013):**
- The card must support a 3D flip animation (click or tap to flip between front and back).
- The backside must include:
  - A circular avatar at the top
  - User name and a short description
  - At least four main action buttons (e.g., channel, blog, outfits, affiliate links)
  - A row of social media icons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify)
  - A visible QR code (for sharing contact or profile info)
  - A visually appealing gradient background and rounded corners
- All elements must be responsive and accessible (keyboard/tab navigation, aria-labels)
- The QR code should be generated dynamically based on the user's profile or contact link
- The design should closely match the provided reference image for layout and style

**All implementations must fulfill these requirements. If a feature or code does not align with these, it should be revised.**
