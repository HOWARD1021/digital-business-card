# Product Requirements: Digital Business Card Scanner

This rule enforces the functional requirements for the Digital Business Card website. All features and implementations must align with the following user stories and expected outcomes:

| Requirement ID | Description | User Story | Expected Behavior/Outcome |
|----------------|-------------|------------|--------------------------|
| FR001 | Uploading Business Card Image | As a user, I want to upload a photo of a business card so I can digitize it. | The system should provide an upload interface that accepts image files (JPG, PNG) of business cards. |
| FR002 | OCR Text Extraction | As a user, I want the system to automatically extract text from my card image. | The system should use OCR to detect and extract text information from the uploaded business card image. |
| FR003 | Information Categories | As a user, I want the extracted information to be organized into categories (name, phone, email, etc.). | The system should categorize extracted text into predefined fields like name, title, company, phone, email, and address. |
| FR004 | Editing Extracted Info | As a user, I want to edit the extracted information if there are any errors. | The system should allow users to modify any automatically extracted information before saving. |
| FR005 | Saving Digital Cards | As a user, I want to save the processed business card to my collection. | The system should store the card image and extracted information in the user's digital card collection. |
| FR006 | Viewing Card Collection | As a user, I want to view all my saved business cards in one place. | The system should provide a dashboard showing all saved business cards with their key information. |
| FR007 | Searching Cards | As a user, I want to search through my saved cards using various criteria. | The system should allow searching by name, company, or other fields within the saved cards. |
| FR008 | Sharing Digital Cards | As a user, I want to share my digital business cards with others. | The system should generate shareable links for individual cards or the entire collection. |
| FR009 | Exporting Contact Info | As a user, I want to export card information to standard formats (vCard, CSV). | The system should provide export options for contact information in common formats. |
| FR010 | Card Organization | As a user, I want to organize my cards into groups or categories. | The system should allow creating folders or tags to organize saved business cards. |
| FR011 | Mobile Compatibility | As a user, I want to capture and process cards directly from my mobile device. | The system should work smoothly on mobile devices with camera integration. |
| FR012 | Data Privacy | As a user, I want my uploaded card information to be secure and private. | The system should implement proper security measures to protect stored business card data. |
| FR013 | Card Backside & Social Profile | As a user, I want to flip the business card to see the back, which shows my profile, links, QR code, and social icons. | The system should allow flipping the card to reveal a profile page with avatar, name, description, main links, QR code, and social icons, styled as a modern digital profile card. The QR code button should replace the backside content with a large QR code image. The QR code content (URL) should be user-definable, but is not implemented yet. |
| FR014 | Comprehensive Shopping List Management | As a user, I want to view and manage all my shopping data (grocery lists, receipts from different stores) in one unified interface. | The system should provide a single page (`/shoplist`) that consolidates all shopping-related data including grocery lists, Woolworths receipts, and PAK'nSAVE receipts. Store names should be clearly distinguished with color-coded tags, and all data should be exportable as CSV. |

**Detailed Rules for Card Flip & Backside (FR013):**
- The card must support a 3D flip animation (click or tap to flip between front and back).
- The backside must include:
  - A circular avatar at the top
  - User name and a short description
  - At least four main action buttons (e.g., channel, blog, outfits, affiliate links)
  - A row of social media icons (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify)
  - A visible QR code (for sharing contact or profile info)
  - A visually appealing gradient background and rounded corners
- All elements must be responsive and accessible (keyboard/tab navigation, aria-labels)
- The QR code should be generated dynamically based on the user's profile or contact link
- The design should closely match the provided reference image for layout and style

**Detailed Rules for Shopping List Management (FR014):**
- All shopping data must be consolidated into a single page (`/shoplist`) accessible via direct URL (hidden from business card UI)
- Store identification must use color-coded tags in the first table column:
  - ðŸ”µ Jadan è¶…å¸‚ (Blue)
  - ðŸŸ¢ Woolworths (Green)  
  - ðŸ”´ PAK'nSAVE (Red)
- Data should include:
  - Original grocery shopping list (19 items from Jadan + Woolworths)
  - Woolworths Mt Eden receipt (14 items)
  - PAK'nSAVE Royal Oak receipt (12 items)
- Summary statistics must show total items count and dual currency totals (NZD/TWD)
- CSV export functionality must include all consolidated data
- Page must use purple-pink gradient theme with responsive design
- Shopping list link is HIDDEN from business card navigation (not visible in UI)

**Implementation Notes:**
- **Path Change:** Updated from `/grocery-list` to `/shoplist` for shorter URL
- **UI Change:** Removed shopping list link from business card backside (hidden from user interface)
- Removed separate `/woolworths-receipt` and `/paknsave-receipt` pages (consolidated into `/shoplist`)
- Shopping list page accessible via direct URL navigation only
- Fixed ESLint issues with apostrophes using HTML entities (&apos;)
- Removed back navigation link from shopping list page for cleaner interface

**Current URL Structure:**
- `/` - Main business card with flip animation
- `/shoplist` - Hidden comprehensive shopping list (not linked from UI)
- `/woolworths-receipt` - Individual Woolworths receipt page  
- `/paknsave-receipt` - Individual PAK'nSAVE receipt page

**All implementations must fulfill these requirements. If a feature or code does not align with these, it should be revised.**
